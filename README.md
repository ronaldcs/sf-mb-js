You are given a function 'secret()' that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. In your favorite programming language, write a command-line program that takes one command-line argument (a number) and determines if the secret() function is additive [secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y)], for all combinations x and y, where x and y are all prime numbers less than the number passed via the command-line argument.  Describe how to run your examples. Please generate the list of primes without using built-in functionality.

How to run:

1. Visit https://repl.it/ByGK/3. Note that this link is essentially a duplicate of the coding-exercise.js file.
2. Click on the "run" button.
3. In the console, run the following command:

   ```javascript
   ce.test(<param>);
   ```

   Where `<param>` is the integer parameter of your choosing.
